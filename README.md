# Accountability-Tools

## This repo will contain accountability tools. 

### First, a "Daily Journal.py", based on the "Five Minute Journal". ###
#### This will give the user a few brief writing prompts, such as "I am grateful for...[3 things]" and "What would make today great [3 things]"
#### It will save the questions and answers, and output to a "journal" file.

### Other tool ideas ###
#### Other tools could include a weekly accountability tool, where the user inputs their weekly pledges, and the script emails the user halfway through the week as a reminder.
#### [Other tool ideas to be added here!]
